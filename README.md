# DEVENV

Containerized, portable environment for development.

# Quick Start

Make the script (`run.sh`) executable, then run the script, supplying desired `username` and `password` 
for your development environment.

```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh <username> <password>
```

After this script completes the editor will be running at `https://<HOST|IP>:3000`. It will prompt 
you for the password you entered when running the script.
